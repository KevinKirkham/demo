This is an animation project that I originally worked as part of the ITEC 324 class at Radford University. The goal was to display 1-3 shapes in a JPanel and have them animate across a JPanel. They were to wrap to the opposite side of the screen when they reached the edge of the screen and the three buttons at the top were originally meant to control the animation, though how the shapes are animated on the screen has since changed.
