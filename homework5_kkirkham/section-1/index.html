        <p>HTML is the Webâ€™s core language for creating content for <strong>everyone</strong> to use
            <strong>anywhere</strong>. The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML.
        </p>
        <p>HTML was originally designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, but its general
            design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of
            documents.</p>

        <p>Style sheets describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are pronounced.
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet mechanism that has been specifically developed to meet the
            needs of Web designers and users.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic
            control over them.</p>

        <p><em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
            an HTML form and respond to user events
            such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
