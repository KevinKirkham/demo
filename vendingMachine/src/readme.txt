The goal of this project that I completed for Radford University's ITEC 324 course was to simulate a vending machine. The user can input money and the select an item, and all errors were to be handled gracefully. An operator mode was to be part of the project as well who would be able to restock the machine when it was low on a certain item or in the event that it didn't have enough money inside of it to make the proper amount of change for a customer who overpaid when purchasing an item.
